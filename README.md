## For site developers

### Build and run locally

This site is built in [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/), and uses Vue/JavaScript for functional code and Markdown for post content.

To build a local copy, run the following:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/web3-storage/docs.git
   ```

1. Move into the `docs` folder and install the NPM dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd docs
   npm install
   ```

1. Boot up the application in _dev mode_:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

1. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
1. Close the local server with `CTRL` + `c`.
1. To restart the local server, run `npm start` from within the `docs` folder.

### PR and preview

Once you're happy with your local changes, please make a PR **against the `main` branch**. Including detailed notes on your PR - particularly screenshots to depict any changes in UI - will help speed up approval and deployment.

All PRs against `main` automatically generate Fleek previews to make it easier to check your work. You can view your PR's preview by clicking `Details` in the `fleek/build` check at the bottom of your PR page:<br/>

Your preview URL will look something like this: `https://<cid>.on.fleek.co` (example: https://bafybeibwksog6le7t6anr4zenlcg2qntrmfznx6e64goree7hmzfsxcnl4.on.fleek.co/)

A reviewer will be by shortly to have a look!

### Hosting / Deployment

We're using Fleek as the hosting and deployment platform.
Auto deployments are enabled on the `main` branch and preview builds are generated when PRs are created merging to the `main` branch.
